Due to the fact that <link page="codex/characters/trevolry/">Professor Trevolry</link> is described as being a <link page="codex/references/goffik/">goff</link>, and she is more of a primary character than just a professor, we've decided that Professor Trevolry (actually: Professor Trelawney) is given the name "Sinister Trevolry" to stay consistent with the "goffs get goff names" mode.</body><tags><tag>sinister</tag><tag>japanese</tag><tag>trevolry</tag><tag>standardization</tag><tag>markup</tag><tag>update</tag><tag>immortal.xml</tag><tag>codex</tag><tag>character names</tag></tags><comments/></post>
