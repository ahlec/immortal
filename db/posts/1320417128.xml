This error is actually pretty interesting because Transfiguration IS about transformation, but it's still the wrong word. Not sure if we want to do something about it, but it's pretty cool.</body><tags><tag>markup</tag><tag>memo</tag><tag>immortal.xml</tag></tags><comments><comment handle="jacob" datetime="1320418093">IMO, it's like with Enoby or Dumblydore; we can reasonably assume that Tara wanted it "Transfigurations," "Ebony," and "Dumbledore" respectively. If that's what your question was?</comment><comment handle="janis" datetime="1320422090">Sort of? I think this kind of error is a little different? idk.</comment><comment handle="jacob" datetime="1320762595">We could also just mark this as malaproper.</comment></comments></post>
