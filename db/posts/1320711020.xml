In order to handle this in the past, we created the element <code><narration/></code>, but now, I feel like <code><pointOfView/></code> would be a more aptly named element, so I went ahead and changed it in the schema (if we don't like it, we are more than able to change it back). But it functions as a head to <code><paragraph/></code> elements, and it also contains a <code>@handle</code> for who is the current narrator.</body><tags><tag>schema</tag><tag>markup</tag></tags><comments><comment handle="jacob" datetime="1320715464">We also needed to add an optional <code>@partOfSpeech</code>, as <link page="read/chapter-37/">chapter 37</link> also contains a point where the reader becomes the main character.</comment></comments></post>
