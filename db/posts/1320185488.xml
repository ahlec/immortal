However, Professor Sinister then goes on to claim ownership of the classroom ('sinister came in. "hey dis is my classroom wait wtf enoby what da hell r u doing?"'). I think this, coupled with the information that we acquired earlier, would make Professor Sinister the same person as Professor Trevolry.</body><tags><tag>trevolry</tag><tag>sinister</tag><tag>markup</tag><tag>japanese</tag><tag>divinations</tag><tag>deviations</tag></tags><comments/></post>
