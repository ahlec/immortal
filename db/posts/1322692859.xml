There is currently a lighter shade of blue in the read page and I really like how that contrasts compared to the darker blue on the homepage.  I think I'm also going to go ahead and see what I can do to fix the navbar.</comment><comment handle="eric" datetime="1322695220">And I REALLY like the maroon on the sidebars of the Read and Codex pages.</comment><comment handle="janis" datetime="1322695228">...aren't those the same blue? I thought we only had one blue for the whole site. #0099ff.</comment><comment handle="eric" datetime="1322695258">It definitely looks lighter to me, I think Jake just did that.</comment><comment handle="janis" datetime="1322695258">Yes, I really like that color and I wish we were using it more.</comment><comment handle="janis" datetime="1322695271">Ohhh, ok.</comment></comments></post>
