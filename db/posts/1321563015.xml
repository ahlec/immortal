Currently you can go to the codex and see a list of all of the eventual pages of content, but only the character pages are capable of being visited, and also, nothing is in its desired format.  I predict functionality to be complete by tonight.</body><tags><tag>codex</tag><tag>project update</tag></tags><comments/></post>
