        <h1>Where It All Began</h1>
        <p>The Immortal project was initially conceived in a tiny college dorm room, when Jacob
            remembered that he had a hard copy of the story in a binder. From there we began with
            the idea that we would be able to perform textual analysis of the story to determine
            whether or not it was a troll, and perform some form of authorship attribution on the
            text - to determine who Tara Gillespie, the story's inscrutable author, was.</p>
        <p>Pretty soon we realized that a) This story is obviously a troll and b) The Internet is
            too vast of an ocean to possibly pinpoint the identity of a fanfiction's author. Our goal
            transitioned into, how does Ms. Gillespie provoke so much response in her readers - what
            made the story so infamous? Our markup became that which targeted elements of style as
            well as elements of plot and character relations, as things we considered to be
            importantly startling about the text.</p>
        <h1>Markup Methodology</h1>
        <p>The core, basic element in our text is the &lt;sp&gt; element, which describes a spelling
            mistake and has an attribute for its intended value. The &lt;sp&gt; can contain no other
            element. For any reader of the story, spelling mistakes are a huge part of what make the
            story so laughable. But there are many other lexical and plot devices that contribute
            equally to the mood of the story. In the process of working, we developed tags for
            grammar mistakes, omitted content (including any kind of word or punctuation), excess
            content (to be removed), and rearrangement of text (for logical purposes).</p>
        <p>The reasons for the lexical mark-up are relatively self-explanatory. But our other tags
            may not be. We marked up characters, dialogue, and sex, all for purposes of detecting
            the occurrences of characters in relation to the plot, relationships between characters,
            and what other contributions they made to the story as a whole. A significant factor in
            Gillespie's success at provoking reader response is the interactions between her
            characters, and their existence as characters in the original Harry Potter story, or
            other stories. For example, Tom Satan Bombadil has his origins in The Lord of The Rings
            series, and Morty McFly originates from the Back to The Future movies. These characters
            are themselves external references, but we also developed a tag for external references
            to look at what kinds of popular culture Gillespie was trying to draw upon.</p>
        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <p>One of the most important factors in our observations is that at the time My Immortal was
            written, fans could write reviews of the story that were publicly posted on the website.
            Since Gillespie includes author's notes at the beginning of every chapter, and almost
            always mentions the act of reviewing, we can infer that her writing will react in
            sympathy to the reactions of her viewers. Following is a list of some of the
            observations we've had as a result of markup using specific elements and their
            attributes.</p>
        <h2>&lt;sp&gt;, &lt;grammar&gt;, &lt;omitted&gt;, &lt;remove&gt;, &lt;redact&gt;</h2>
        <p>Spelling mistakes are by far the most common and abused elements of the story. Although
            occasionally Tara exploits poor grammar within the story, for the most part her
            sentences are well formed and relatively complex in structure. This contrast between
            Tara's grammatical talent and lexical disability makes the reader aware that the author
            is capable of writing well, but unwilling to do so. This is a key element in any troll,
            but pulled off very well in this story. Along the same derivation of thought we can look
            at Tara's use of words we labeled "malapropers": a word used in place of one that would
            fit logically in the same position in the text, and that very similarly resembles it.
            These are often homophones (which we made a separate tag for), but not necessarily. The
            most provoking uses of malapropers are when the author will use what some may call a
            "big word," some rare part of the English vocabulary rarely encountered except for in
            rich prose, and use it in place of a common word. The reader is immediately surprised by
            the complexity of the word used, especially if it approaches making sense in the given
            context, and then perturbed by the irony that the author has a wealth of knowledge about
            the English language and chooses not to employ it, except for in a facetious manner. The
            following is a good example of this type of creative word
choice:</p><p><blockquote>"I have to
                tell you the fucking <span style="font-style:italic">perdition</span>."</blockquote>
           <p>Here, perdition, meaning eternal damnation of the soul, fits well into the gothic,
            vampiric, suicidal and other tropes of the story, but is not actually intended to be
            said in its context. The sentence was spoken dialogue by Professor Trevolry, who was
            instead telling a prediction, not a perdition. A few lines later, this becomes even more
            (or perhaps less) clear, as Trevolry looks into a <span style="font-style:italic"
                >crucible</span> (crystal) ball to make said
                >prediction.</p><blockquote>"She started to
                look into a black <span style="font-style:italic">crucible</span>
                ball."</blockquote><p>While the ball could be described as crucible, the reader can
            smell the fishy appearance of these sorts of words. One interesting observation that was
            quickly made by viewing the chart representing spelling mistakes 'By Chapter,' is that
            malapropers, after having little to no usage, suddenly appear in the text about halfway
            through, at chapter 26. We can gauge that Tara might have responded to interaction with
            her fans writing reviews on the story. Fans, having a tendency to comment on the most
            outrageous, likely would have commented on the instigating nature of her earlier uses of
            malapropers, and inspired her to actively use them as a form of spelling mistake.</p>
        <p>Simple quantitative information we were able to generate using digital tools provides
            shocking evidence of the author's efforts at inciting an emotional response from her
            readers. In total, there were approximaly 5,200 spelling mistakes in My Immortal,
            accompanied by nearly 700 grammar mistakes (and more, when accounting for our insertion
            of punctuation which were not tagged as grammatical errors). An impressive number of
            these occurred in chapters 41 and 42, easily the longest chapters in the story,
            something also readily observable in the 'By Chapter' graph.</p>
        <p>Using our graphs in combination allows for some new insight on Gillespie's trolling
            methodologies and could possibly clear up confusion about certain outliers. Anomilies in
            chapter-by-chapter spelling count can be dissected in the 'By Sentence' graph upon
            selection of the respective chapter. Also, seeing the most commonly used mistake in a
            given chapter (the tallest bar in the 'By Chapter' graph), the occurrence of this
            mistake can be followed in the sentence-by-sentence graph more closely.</p>
        <p>The &lt;remove&gt;, &lt;redact&gt;, and &lt;omitted&gt; tags are all used for editorial
            purposes; to make the revised version of the story less nonsensical and more
            grammatically correct, we devised these methods of rearranging words, removing extra
            content, and inserting clearly missing elements of the text. Much of what we ended up
            removing were extra words jutting into the logic of a sentence, and the most commonly
            inserted items were commas and quotation marks, due to the frequent absence of
            organizational punctuation.</p>
        <h2>&lt;char&gt;, &lt;dialogue&gt;</h2><p>There are 35 unique characters in "My Immortal,"
            but the balance between the prevalence of characters is highly skewed. Of the 5,580
            total mentions of characters &ndash; either as passing references, character dialogues,
            pronouns, or what have you &ndash; 2,021 of those are by/of Ebony alone; Draco Malfoy
            comes in second with 792 occurrences. This startling difference between the two most
            prevalent features of any kind in the story is made more significant when noted that
            Ebony appears in all 44 chapters of the story, but Draco appears in 41 out of the 44.
            Although the story is told in first person, which should be taken into account when
            comparing these two figures, the sheer imbalance of the characters throughout the story
            is still inexcusable.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there are 761 instances of dialogue in the story, with approximately 300 of
            those spoken by Ebony. Draco Malfoy, the second most vocal character, follows with 78
            instances. As for length of quotes, only 489 of the 761 instances of dialogue in the
            story are longer than one word. No character speaks more than Ebony, and in reading the
            story, it is easily apparent without actual consideration. But due to the prevalence
            of... Ebony, for lack of a better portrayal... and due to the nature of first-person
            stories in general, most of the story itself takes places outside the extraneous
            dialogue of the story.</p>
        <h2>&lt;ref&gt;</h2>
        <p>Tara uses references extensively throughout the story, with almost 1000 references made
            in total and over 100 unique references, excluding those characters like Tom Satan
            Bombadil and Marty McFly. Including these two, the count rises beyond 1000. Obviously,
            Tara's use of references in the story is significant.</p>
        <p>Many of these references relate to the gothic, satanic and other tropes mentioned earlier
            in regard to malapropers. These tropes have been something very commonly mocked on the
            internet, even since the time of this story's creation - if one thinks of the stigma
            associated with the vampiristic Twilight series, they can get a picture of what is being
            mocked here. By exaggerating an obsession with figures in goth, punk, satanistic, and
            other communities in the real world, Tara instills anger in members of them, and humor
            in those who mock them. For example, the reference Gerard Way, lead singer of My
            Chemical Romance, is a favorite of the main character Ebony, and already appears in the
            first chapter.</p>
        <blockquote>"I'm not related to <span style="font-style:italic">Gerard Way</span>, but I
            wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie."</blockquote>
        <p>Other references simply relate back to the original story of Harry Potter, but obliterate
            any contextual basis of referencing them. Objects like horcruxes, the time turner,
            various potions and spells, and plenty of settings taken from the story are all stripped
            of their contextual value and transformed into 'goffikally' endowed, Gillespian
            entitities.</p>
        <h2>&lt;sex&gt;, &lt;kiss&gt;</h2>
        <p>Despite the seeming prevalence of sex and kissing throughout the story, there are
            (relative to the story as a whole) few actual instances of sex or kissing. When there
            are, the tags &lt;sex&gt; and &lt;kiss&gt; respectively are used, to denote the action.
            The placement of these elements is rather fluid, as the act of kissing or of sex has the
            capability of being contained in a single sentence, or over the course of multiple
            paragraphs. In part because of the portrayed nature of Tara's bisexuals, and also
            because of her nigh-erotica usage of sexual acts to further plot points, sex and kissing
            can occur between any two or more characters. The three most frequent couplings to occur
            (or be mentioned), however, would be Ebony/Draco, Draco/Vampire, and Ebony/Vampire. This
            actual love triangle becomes the sole focus of the plot for a decent portion of the
            story as a whole.</p>
        <p> The use of &lt;sex&gt; and &lt;kiss&gt; has the ability to explicitly denote
            interactions and relations (because those two are not the same thing in this story)
            between two (again, or more) characters. But because it requires the actual act of sex
            or kissing to be taking place, it has a limitation that it cannot be used to denote
            mentions of the act of sex or kissing &ndash; it does not have the ability to be used
            when Ebony refers to "losing [her] virility to Draco." To remedy (not fully, but at
            least capture these mentions), a reference for "havingSex" was created, and used any
            time something sexual is mentioned. "havingSex" is used 37 times in the story, as
            opposed to the 11 instances of explicit &lt;sex&gt;. &lt;kiss&gt;ing occurs 23 times.
            But in the way the story is written, these numbers seem significantly below the
            expected.</p>
        <h2>&lt;attire&gt;</h2>
        <p>Articles of clothing are extensively described in this story, which we've tracked with
            &lt;attire&gt;. These come in a small number of colors and include a large number of
            band t-shirts. Chapters include on average around 6 articles of clothing, and one
            chapter has an outstanding 35 mentions of attire. Typically a character's entire outfit
            will be described, but these outfits generally have little coordination and would be
            quite the sight to see.</p><blockquote>Anyway when I got better I went upstairs and put on
                a black leather minidress that was all ripped on the ends with lace on it. There was
                some corset stuff on the front. Then I put on black fishnets and black high-heeled
                boots with pictures of Billie Joe Armstrong on them. I put my hair all out around me
                so I looked like Samara from the Ring (if u don't know who she iz ur a prep so fuk
                off!) and I put on blood-red lipstick, black eyeliner and black lip
                gloss.</blockquote><p>Here Tara combines unlikely elements <span
                style="font-style:italic;">black leather</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;"
                >lace</span> and includes references to <span style="font-style:italic">Billie Joe
                Armstrong</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Samara</span> to bombard the
            reader's imagination. Tara frequently references outfits having <span
                style="font-style:italic;">corset stuff</span>, although she never describes what
            exactly this entails. Clothes are frequently made of unlikely materials, for instance
            once Enoby is mentioned wearing a leather bra, and there are a few instances of fishnets
            made of leather. Throughout the story, there are a total of 249 articles of clothing,
            112 of which are Ebony's. Yet some of the most entertaining images are of the other
            characters.</p><blockquote> She was weaving a ripped gothic black dress with ripped stuff
                all over it and a lace-up top thing and black pointy boots. So were Crab and
                Goyle.</blockquote><p>By implying that Crab and Goyle are wearing dresses, Tara trolls
            the reader quite effectively.</p>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>The combination of the elements discussed above create the unique character of this story
            which makes it so inflammatory. The beginning chapters are relatively benign, consisting
            of less than 10 percent errors. As the story progresses, however, the errors become more
            prevalent and make up a more significant portion of each chapter. Chapter 38, for
            example, is 45% errors. Yet, when these are corrected, the story remains a troll. The
            extensive use of references, the ridiculous sexual and romantic relations, and the
            bizarre character names remain to antagonize the reader. It is thus the content itself,
            compounded by the poor spelling and grammar, which create such a response in readers
            from all backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Supporting our previous assertion that Tara adjusts her writing style in response to
            reviews received, we can see there is a fairly steady increase in the number of
            references used in each chapter, one chapter containing as many as 79 references spread
            over only 81 sentences. Such a high concentration of content which is irrelevant to the
            world of Harry Potter is remarkable. Part of what makes fanfiction appealing is its
            expansion of a particular fandom's (such as Harry Potter's) universe beyond the base
            work. So by largely ignoring this in favor of real world bands like My Chemical Romance
            and Good Charlotte serves as a slap in the face to readers. Tara exploits this to the
            fullest with her extensive use of external referencing in "My Immortal."</p>
